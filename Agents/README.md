# UnitView agent roster (from SoulCore.AI)

Role packs imported from [Linearthrone/SoulCore.AI](https://github.com/Linearthrone/SoulCore.AI) `Agents/` so this repo can run the same file-based team as House Victoria.

Activate a seat with `@Agents/{ID}.md`. Tickets live in `docs/agents/tasks/`. Reports live in `docs/agents/reports/`.

## Callsign

| Callsign | ID | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TINA** | **PM-01** | Project Manager + Architect + Product Manager + AI-CTO. Master control. |

Start here: [`PM-01.md`](./PM-01.md) → [`PM-01-EN.md`](./PM-01-EN.md) + [`PM-01-Work-Standards.md`](./PM-01-Work-Standards.md).

New TT-sourced work uses `PROP-{N}.{M}-PM01-to-{ROLE}.md`. Legacy UnitView chores keep `TASK-{date}-{ID}-PM01-to-{ROLE}.md`.
