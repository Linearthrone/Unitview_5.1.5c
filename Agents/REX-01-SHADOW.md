# REX-01 · SHADOW ACTIVATE

> **Kurt: drop this file on the shadow PC and start a Cursor agent with `@Agents/REX-01-SHADOW.md` (or `@` this path wherever you put it).**
>
> You are **REX-01** on the **shadow** machine. This is the only valid seat for Unreal **Play / PIE** Pass evidence.
> SoulCore Host / Ollama / ChatDesktop stay on Kurt’s **home** PC — do **not** move them here.

## 0a. If every tool is blocked (ACE hook)

Shadow Cursor may load `.cursor/scripts/ace_pre_tool_use.ps1`. If that script prints anything except JSON, **all tools die**.

Kurt: disable the ACE `preToolUse` hook in **Settings → Hooks**, **or** replace the script with the repo copy (see `docs/runbooks/cursor-ace-hook-fix.md`). Then re-@ this file and say `Start PROP-2.1.`

## 0. How Kurt drops you here (one-time)

1. On **home**, pull `main` (or this PR branch) so `Agents/REX-01-SHADOW.md` exists.
2. Copy **at least this file** onto the shadow PC, either:
   - into a Soul_Core clone on shadow (`…\Soul_Core\Agents\REX-01-SHADOW.md`), **preferred**, or
   - onto the Desktop / next to MyProject (any path Cursor can `@`).
3. On shadow: open Cursor → Agent chat → `@REX-01-SHADOW.md` → send:  
   `Activate as REX-01 shadow. Start PROP-2.1.`
4. Optional but useful: clone or sync `Soul_Core` on shadow so you can run `tools\ue_nav\*.ps1` and write reports under `docs\agents\reports\`. If Soul_Core is only on home, write the Pass report on home after shadow evidence, or sync the report file back.

**Tailscale / RC hostname (from repo):** `house-victoria` · body bridge `:8888` · editor remote Control `:30010`.

## 1. You are REX — hard rules (never violate)

1. **Player PIE DefaultPawn = Kayleigh only** — `/Game/Characters/BP_KayleighCharacter` (tag `KayleighPlayer`).
2. **NEVER** set player Default Pawn / GameMode pawn / AutoPossess to Victoria (`BP_VictoriaCharacter`, `VictoriaAvatar`, `BP_MHC_Victoria`, etc.).
3. **Victoria stays AI** for `HouseVictoriaBridge` (`:8888`). AI loco/speak OK; **player** possess Victoria = automatic **FAIL**.
4. **Do not reparent** `BP_MHC_Kayleigh` / `BP_MHC_Victoria` to `ACharacter`.
5. Flying stock `ADefaultPawn` ghost = **FAIL**.
6. Host / RC `success:true` or pipeline log alone = **not Pass**. Pass only with **shadow Play** evidence Kurt can see.

## 2. Canonical paths on this machine

Fill/confirm on first activate if paths differ:

| Item | Expected (edit if wrong) |
| --- | --- |
| MyProject | `…\Unreal Projects\MyProject\MyProject.uproject` (UE **5.8**) |
| Home map | `/Game/Home` |
| Player pawn | `/Game/Characters/BP_KayleighCharacter` |
| Victoria (AI only) | tag `VictoriaAvatar` |
| Soul_Core (if present) | wherever Kurt cloned it on shadow |
| Evidence folder | `tmpcode\rex-shadow\` (create if missing) |
| Body WS | `ws://127.0.0.1:8888` (Host on home points at `ws://<shadow>:8888`) |

Authoritative content may sync from **home Perforce / P4**. Play Pass is **only** valid here.

## 3. Do this now — PROP queue (serial on shadow)

| Order | ID | Goal | Status gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1 — START** | **PROP-2.1** | Shadow PIE = **1P Kayleigh** (finish TASK-191) | no Pass → stop |
| 2 | PROP-2.2 | Victoria travel-cm + loco AnimBP (AI) | after 2.1 Pass |
| 3 | PROP-2.3 | One Presence `eye_frame` still (Victoria) | after 2.1 |
| HOLD | PROP-2.4 / TASK-192 | Call waist-up camera — **do not** feed Presence | held until 2.1 Pass |

Ticket files (if Soul_Core present): `docs/agents/tasks/PROP-2.1-PM01-to-REX01.md` … `PROP-2.4-…`.  
Reports: `docs/agents/reports/PROP-2.1-REX01-to-PM01.md` (etc.).

### PROP-2.1 sit-down (must Pass first)

1. Sync latest MyProject / plugin from home P4 (or Kurt’s copy).
2. **Full module rebuild** of `HouseVictoriaBridge` + **editor restart** (Live Coding alone is not the ship path for new GameMode UCLASS).
3. Open `/Game/Home` → save World Settings GameMode with Kayleigh DefaultPawn.
4. Kill duplicate body listeners — **one** `:8888`.
5. **Play** (PIE or standalone on this box). Confirm:

| Check | Pass |
| --- | --- |
| Possessed class / name | contains **Kayleigh** |
| Not Victoria | player is **not** Victoria |
| Not ghost | grounded walk, not flying DefaultPawn |
| Camera | **strict first person** |
| Input | WASD grounded |

6. Evidence: screenshot of possessed class / Outliner name + still or short clip of 1P view → `tmpcode\rex-shadow\`.
7. File report `PROP-2.1-REX01-to-PM01.md` with status Pass | Fail | Partial.

If Soul_Core tools exist:

```powershell
cd <Soul_Core>
.\tools\ue_nav\run_rex_pie_possess_kayleigh.ps1
# then Play here and prove possess — script alone is not Pass
```

## 4. What you do **not** own on shadow

- Running SoulCore Host / ALLSTART / Ollama / Hermes / Playwright browser workspace
- DIGITS / SMS gateway work
- Declaring Pass from home-PC PIE or remote Control Python alone when Play was not verified here

## 5. Report stub (paste into report file)

## 6. First message after activate

Reply to Kurt with:

1. Confirmed MyProject path + UE version  
2. Whether Soul_Core is on this machine  
3. Current GameMode DefaultPawnClass (if readable)  
4. Then start **PROP-2.1** without waiting for more tickets
